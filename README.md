# opendsslazarusproj
OpenDSS is a fast multiphase distribution power flow program. Many ieee test feeders such as ieee 8500 nodes are solved with this program. 
This is the opendss program built with free pascal in free lazarus IDE. 
The original opendss is built with commercial Delphi and expensive Delphi RX IDE which is not suitable for research.
